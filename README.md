## Description

The purpose of this challenge is to create a social network using monogoose, an alternative to sql, to create and store user and user's information on the backend. 

In completing this challenge, I learned how to build models, create controllers and routes using monogoose and reinforced my understanding of the MVC paradigm for building backend APIs. Overall, the challenge was more of review with a few adaptations to make it work with monogoose.

## Installation 

install mongoose and express in the terminal of vscode or a similiar program.

## Usage

If they wish to look at the code, after installing depedencies, start the server using server.js in the terminal and open insomnia or a similiar program to test API routes .

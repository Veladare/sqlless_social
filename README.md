## Description

The purpose of this challenge is to create a social network using monogoose, an alternative to sql, to create and store user and user's information on the backend. 

In completing this challenge, I learned how to build models, create controllers and routes using monogoose. It reinforced my understanding of the MVC paradigm for building backend APIs.

## Installation 

install mongoose and express in the terminal of vscode or a similiar program.

## Usage

If they wish to look at the code, after installing depedencies, start the server using server.js in the terminal and open insomnia or a similiar program to test API routes .
